Architects deal with data every single day as each design projects begin with collection and analysis of geospatial data. 
I have also worked extensively with data analaytics as a researcher in architectural history.
I am learning to code in Python to build a strong foundation in programming and I hope to leverage Data Science and AI for design and built property analysis.
